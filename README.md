## Downloading

First, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then, clone this repository, change your terminal's directory to be inside of the `Find-A-Bus-Online` folder, and type `npm install` into the terminal. If you don't already have `sass` downloaded (type `which sass` into the terminal to see), then you'll need to download it with `npm install -g sass@1.26.3` (you may need to run this prefixed with `sudo`). You should have all of the project files you need.

## Developing

But, right now, your changes won't actually work entirely correctly. First, download [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). You will need to install the extension [DartJS Sass Compiler and Sass Watcher
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codelios.dartsass) in order to edit styles. Type `npm start` in your terminal to open a live server and start developing!
